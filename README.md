# speed
adds a semi normal playing ground for minetest mobile clients that do not have a special key (sprint) i felt like mobile clients were at a disadvantage so i made this to hopefully make the playing field a little bit more equal.
use /speed to modify your speed to sprinting speed at the cost of your fast priv (ability to sprint normally) and /unspeed to get normal walking speed which grants you your fast priv back.
